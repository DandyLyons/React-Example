## Roadmap

- [ ] Pick a free design on Figma. (Go to the [GitHub Discussions page](https://github.com/DandyLyons/React-Example/discussions/3) of this repo to submit suggestions. I will pick a design before Tuesday.)
- [ ] Generate issues to work on.
- [ ] Assign issues to pair programmer teams.
- [ ] Create a *Contributors* page within the React app, to highlight all the contributors. 

*For this project, we will first focus primarily on frontend development, since this is what we have learned so far.*
